The agent explores the environment on its own without any prior data and based on the action it takes and the reward it gets on each action, the agent tries to maximize that reward.

In the given case, the agent's goal is to reach the final position (Green cube) while exploring the map. Every time it lands on green cube it gets a reward of +10 and -10 for red cubes. The number on each tile represents the action that the agent will take on a particular tile.
